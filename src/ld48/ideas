Minimalism....

Minimal input?
	- Only move and action...
	- Probably going to be done by everyone ever

Minimal art?
	- No actual art assets, just blocks...
	- too easy... where's the fun in that

Minimal tasks to do?
	- Like what?
	
	
	
	
	Minimalism is any design or style in which the simplest and fewest elements are used to create the maximum effect.
	
		- Take some everyday complicated thing and simplify it.
		- What is complicated? Rocket Science. Brain Surgery.
		
		
Just a really simple minigame?
	- Click the squares.
	- Something with squares. squares are easy.
	
Minimal direction from the game? Just a bunch of crap and nothing telling you what to do.

Ok so there's basic drawing. What am I making?

GOT IT. A world full of things that give you points, but you need to complete the game getting as few points as possible
	- Run with this, because why not.
	- So, what happens when you get too many points?
		- Die after so many.
		- Each one makes the game less colorful? Could be a cool trick
		- Collecting coins slows you down?
	- What gives points?
		- Coins
		- Killing enemies
		- Floating fruits
	- What is the hero like?
		- Weapon? Sword, gun, fists?
